　　Hello, this is AXiang speaking. Today is January 15, 2025, and it was Wednesday. 

　　First part, how do you feel about today? I think it was fucking tired. But however, there is also some enjoyable things. 

　　Second part, what happened today? Firstly, I do a lot of work and was fucking tired. Yes, fucking tired. Secondly, in the afternoon, I ordered some noodles. if it was in the past, I would order a small portion of noodles. But if I order a small one, maybe I will feel hungry when I get off work. So I ordered a big one. It cost 7 yuan if I order a small one. And the large one cost me 11 yuan. So I get a large one.

　　When I was about to get off work, I invited my friend to play badminton with me. It was around 5 p.m. I said to him, I didn't get off work at that time. And it was around 8 p.m. So, yes, I got off work and went home. I found the wind was blowing. Maybe this weather is not suitable for playing badminton. Maybe I will cancel badminton playing. Yes. Then I made dinner and ate dinner. And it was about 8 p.m.  So I went outside and saw the weather. I saw if the wind was big or not. I found it didn't matter. It wasn't a big issue. So I went to the badminton court. It was just okay. So I sent a message to my friend. And called him to come here. And so we enjoyed the badminton playing about one hour and go home. 

　　Yes. This is my day.
