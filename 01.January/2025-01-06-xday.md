It's been six days, but it's a failure to start writing a diary in the new year.  Last night, I read a little book, some of which made my eyes shine. For example, it is said that there are three layers of wisdom in our life. The first level is choice, the second level is determination, and the third level is game.  What we need to do is to choose the right thing, then stick to it and keep learning, so as to win this war  。

so，what is the right thing ? how could I find a right thing ? I don't know .  But I know reading is a right thing , doing sports is a right thing , learning English is a right thing . There is  many right thing we could choose.  so then ?

self-discipline  is hard 。but doing difficult things can make people grow.

what should i do in the next ? 

- reading daily for 2 hours .
- doing sports (running , etc...)
- learn english. (2 hour)
