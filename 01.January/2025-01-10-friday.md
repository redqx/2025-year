　　Hello, this is Axiang speaking. Today is January 10th, 2025. 

　　So first part, how do I feel about my day? I think today is a very different day because I helped a little boy  go home. 

　　Second part, what happened today?

　　When I go home from work, I bought a roasted duck and I made an egg fried rice for dinner. I think there is not too much egg fried rice. If I finish eating, I will be hungry. So I boiled some noodles. But I overcooked it. I mean, I throw to much  noodles into the pot. I think it's difficult for me to eat all the  food I prepared. But I must finish eating all food. Otherwise, it will be wasted. And when I finish my dinner,  I just want to play badminton. So I go to there . When I get there, there is nobody. So I just find a chair and sit on . Sit on it, playing my phone while waiting for other people to come here to play with me. I wait for a long time and there is no people.But there is still two second graders. No, no, no. There is still some elementary school students come here. One is a boy and the other is a girl. The girl is the boy's sister.

　　Their badminton skills are very low. So I didn't want to play with him. But there is no people to play with me. So I just compromised myself to play with them. We didn't play too much time. So I played a while and left. When I got home, I found a little boy lying on the ground crying. And he was surrounded by two another boys. I found there may be some problems with them. So I came to them. And  the two another boys said to me, "Hey, bro.  the little boy was crying and was saying no words. And I think you can, maybe you can help him." So  I agree. And they just handed over the boy to me. And they left. I asked the boy what happened to him. He said his temple was hurt. He had a pain in his head. So I asked him where his mother and what his mother's phone number. He said his mother  was nearby on a street, but he forget his mother's phone number. So I, so I ask him that I can hold him and  find his mother. He agreed. So I hold the boy and take his handbag and his clothes. But he was too heavy. So I, I walked a while. And I rest a while. Because he is so heavy.  when I get the destination he said.   his mother was not there. And it makes me exhausting.

　　So,  I ask him where his home. He said he know his home. So we follow the same route. And then  go back to his home. he is so heavy. So we walk a while. And rest a while. When I rest in a place. And we heard his mother just calling him. Because he didn't go home for a long time. And his mother was worried about him. The boy heard his mother'calling , adn than replied to his mother. 

　　I called his mother too. Said she just come here. And I explained to him what the situation is. And what happened to the boy. And his mother said thanks to me help him. And they just go home. So I just go home. And this is about my day. 

　　Finally, I think I was happy to help the boy. You, you know when I decided,it was bothered me a lot. You know. Do one more thing is worse than do a less thing. But you know. There is somebody waiting for you to help. I think you must, I must help him. So I just go out. Yes. This is my day.
